Treat The Sphero.edu IDE as an enviroment for transferring code to the
device, and making quick changes. But store the code elsewhere besides
on the Sphero server. I had written a bit of code on Friday. When I
tried to view it the following Monday I got an error message that the
file was not a correctly formatted ".iab" file.

So store your code elsewhere, be it on a computer or on a service like GitHub.
